1. How many seconds are there in 42 minutes 42 seconds?


To calculate the total number of seconds:
(42 Ã— 60) + 42 = 2562 seconds


2. How many miles are there in 10 kilometers? Hint: there are 1.61 kilometers in a mile.

6.21 miles

3. If you run a 10 kilometer race in 42 minutes 42 seconds, what is your average pace (time per mile in minutes and seconds)? What is your average speed in miles per hour?

time_in_minutes = 42 + 42 / 60
time_in_hours = time_in_minutes / 60

distance_in_km = 10
distance_in_miles = distance_in_km / 1.61

average_pace = time_in_minutes / distance_in_miles
average_speed = distance_in_miles / time_in_hours

print(average_pace)
print(average_speed)
