1. In a print statement, what happens if you leave out one of the parentheses, or both?

Syntactical Error

2. If you are trying to print a string, what happens if you leave out one of the quotation marks, or both?

a syntax error occurs because it reads one but fails to find the matching one to complete the string.

3. You can use a minus sign to make a negative number like -2. What happens if you put a plus sign before a number? What about 2++2?


The presence of a plus sign before a number does not alter its value. In the expression "2++2", the two plus signs adjacent to each other are interpreted as indicating a positive number followed by another positive number.

4. In math notation, leading zeros are okay, as in 02. What happens if you try this in Python?


Python attempts to interpret numbers with leading zeros as octal values but decides to convert them to decimal values instead. This can lead to issues with numbers containing an 8 or 9, as octal representation does not include these digits; octal 010 is equivalent to decimal 8, and octal 011 is equivalent to decimal 9.

5. What happens if you have two values with no operator between them?


Typing in two values with no operator and a space between them results in a syntax error. This occurs because without an operator, the interpreter lacks a clear directive on the action it is supposed to perform.
